# Identify tools that will allow you to do the following:

## Scan infrastructure as code templates

There are several; new ones come out too quickly to keep up

1. Checkov
2. Terrascan
3. Regula / OPA
4. Synk

### Example vulnerability

IAC static scanners will find s3 buckets with public access, policies with Allow: "*", overly permissive security groups.

##Scan AMIâ€™s or containers for OS vulnerabilities

1. Twistlock
2. JFrog XRay
3. BlackDuck

### Example vulnerability

Container and Machine Image Scanners will find components with known vulnerabilities and misconfigured containers
(log4j vulnerabilities, containers running as root, etc.)

##Scan an AWS environment for cloud configuration vulnerabilities

In addition to the scanners introduced in this course:

1. Security Hub
2. Amazon Inspector
3. Guard Duty
4. Nessus
5. Qualys
6. ThreatStack

### Example vulnerability

These will also do static analysis of misconfigured policies and overly permissive security groups. But they  also
watch and analyze logs and report on suspicious events.
