Based on the architecture diagram, and the steps you have taken so far to upload data and access the application web service, identify at least 2 obvious poor practices as it relates to security.  Include justification.

# Poor practice 1

Web Server is unprotected on public subnet. To improve network security for web server,
- move to private subnet
- further lock down access through security groups and network acls
- add bastion host or session manager to manage connections

# Poor practice 2

Secret Recipe Vault has only minimal protection.  To improve secret vault,
- Add encryption and versioning
- Add VPC endpoint and add S3 bucket policy to restrict to VPC
- Add monitoring and auditing
- Add policies to bucket to further restrict access (MFA)
