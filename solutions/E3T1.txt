# Describe GuardDuty findings that were detected related to the brute force attack

GuardDuty reported:

> i-068c5f860f3fefb9a is performing SSH brute force attacks against 10.192.10.54. Brute force 
> attacks are used to gain unauthorized access to your instance by guessing the SSH password.

# Research the AWS Guard Duty documentation page and explain how GuardDuty may have detected this attack - i.e. what was its source of information.

GuardDuty uses the VPC Flow Logs to detect the SSH Brute Force Attack by monitoring both inbound and outbound traffic on port 22.

The attack was detected twice:

- First, the target of the attack was detected by analyzing inbound traffic patterns to port 22 to the web server instance in the VPC Flow logs,
  indicating that the web server is being scanned. This would be found even if the scan was from an external host.

- Second, the source of the attack was detected by analyzing outbuond traffic patterns to port 22 from the attack instance in the VPC Flow logs,
  indicating that the attacker has been compromised and is being used to attack other hosts.  This would be found even if the compromised
  system were attacking external hosts.
