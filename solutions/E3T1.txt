# Describe GuardDuty findings that were detected related to the brute force attack

GuardDuty reported:

> i-068c5f860f3fefb9a is performing SSH brute force attacks against 10.192.10.54. Brute force 
> attacks are used to gain unauthorized access to your instance by guessing the SSH password.

# Research the AWS Guard Duty documentation page and explain how GuardDuty may have detected this attack - i.e. what was its source of information.

Interestingly, AWS reported this brute force attack twice.  It detected that the web host was being scanned, and flagged those
scans as relatively low severity.

But it also detected that the scans were originating at another EC2 instance, and flagged that information as high severity, since
it indicated that the scanning host may be compromised.
