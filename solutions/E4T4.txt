# What additional architectural change can be made to reduce the internet facing attack surface of the web application instance.

1. Put the web application in a private subnet, and restrict access to only the load balancer
2. Add a firewall in front of the web application and load balancer

# Assuming the IAM permissions for the S3 bucket are still insecure, would creating VPC private endpoints for S3 prevent the unauthorized access to the secrets bucket.

1. Yes. Adding a VPC private endpoint and a policy restricting access to that VPC would reduce exposure.
2. In addition, encrypting the bucket with keys which are also restricted to specific IAM roles would add a second layer of security

# Will applying default encryption setting to the s3 buckets encrypt the data that already exists?

1. It does not

# What would happen if the original cloud formation templates are applied to this environment.

1. I believe the encryption settings and security group changes would be rolled back (i.e., the "drift" would be removed)
