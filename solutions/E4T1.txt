# Identify 2-3 changes that can be made to our environment to prevent an ssh brute force attack from the internet.

1. Remove password authentication from all ssh servers
2. Restrict port 22 to specific source address ranges or network routes
3. REmove all direct access and add a bastion host or session manager

# Neither instance should have had access to the secret recipes bucket, in the even that instance API credentials were compromised how could we have prevented access to sensitive data.

1. Limit the webserver IAM role policy to only reading the free bucket (least priviledge)
2. Better, add policy to the secret bucket to restrict access to specific roles or network routes
3. Best, encrypt the S3 secret bucket with a CMK and restrict access to the CMK
