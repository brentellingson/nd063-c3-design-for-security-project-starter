Research and analyze which of the vulnerabilities appear to be related to the code that was deployed for the environment in this project.

There were four big categories of vulnerabilities found:

1. network routes are open.  Remove all unneeded routes from security groups and access control lists. Remove unneeded public IP addresses.
2. encryption is not enabled.  Add encryption to S3 buckets and EBS volumes
3. logging is not enabled.  Add cloudtrail logging and cloudwatch monitoring
4. s3 bucket policies missing.  Remove public access, and add policies to restrict access.

# Security Hub Found most relevant Critical and High Findings
## CIS AWS findings Related to Code:

- No security groups should allow ingress from 0.0.0.0/0 -- related to deployed code
- Ensure CloudTrail is enabled in all regions -- baseline security setting
- Ensure a log metric filter and alarm exist for changes (VPC, SG, IAM, API calls, etc.) -- baseline security setting

## AWS Foundational findings related to Code:

- S3 Block Public Access setting should be enabled at the bucket-level
- EC2 instances should not have a public IPv4 address
- EC2 instances should use Instance Metadata Service Version 2 (IMDSv2)
- Attached EBS volumes should be encrypted at-rest
- EBS default encryption should be enabled
- The VPC default security group should not allow inbound and outbound traffic
- S3 buckets should have server-side encryption enabled
- S3 buckets should require requests to use Secure Socket Layer
